# Fixed_e-greedy-Algorithm-for-Multi-Armed-Bandit-Problem
This project implements the Îµ-greedy algorithm to solve the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem, which is a classic reinforcement learning scenario. The primary challenge in this problem is decision-making under uncertainty, where an agent must balance exploration and exploitation to maximize cumulative rewards over time.
